# Pytorch Implementation of U-Net
Based on Model ideated by Olaf Ronneberger, *"U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation"* and implementation by GitHub user [@milesial](https://github.com/milesial) [https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet]

This repo includes:
- Model Architecture
- Sample dataset taken from [https://github.com/YimianDai/open-sirst-v2]: Resized and Normalized to fit into model
- Training Script
- Prediction Script (with visualization)
- Evaluation Metrics
